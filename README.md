# file-sorter-c
 A file sorter by type in the C programming language. I also used Zed, Makefiles, clang, and gcc with ChatGPT's help to understand the error messages.

 ### Disclaimer:
 I made This pretty unorganized and clumsy project to learn the C programming language. The code's quality, performance, and memory security might not be the best, but it works.
